Starbucks,Calgary,5149 Country Hills Boulevard NW,4.5,5,"By now I probably sound like a complete Country Hills Plaza snob, but I'm quickly coming to the conclusion that my fondest memories and my most fun times always somehow happen to trace back to this general area. Imagine that.

So here goes.

This particular Starbucks is, yes, located in the Country Hills Plaza. I love it cause it's big and because it's not overwhelmingly packed. The staff is wonderful and obviously they serve all my favourite Starbucks goodies.

I also love this Starbucks because once you're done getting your java jolt, there's a lot of stuff you can do in the area. You can go tanning(having a perma-tan, this one's not on the top of my personal To-Do list), you can go grocery shopping, you can rent movies, you can get take out, and the list goes on and on. And if you're feeling gluttonous because you had one too many bites of that delicious Starbucks brownie, then you can go for a pleasant walk in the ravines.

I love Starbucks and I clearly love the Country Hills Plaza... so what could be better than a Starbucks INSIDE of the Country Hills Plaza?!?!? 

'Nuff Said!"
Starbucks,Chandler,"1085 W Queen Creek Rd, B",4,5,This is my favourite Starbucks!!! Great service and they all know what I want when they see me and call me by my first name!! This Starbucks doesn't have a drive thru but I love the great service and good coffee
Starbucks,Cleveland,3100 W 117th St,3.5,5,"I came here on Sunday, March 11, 2018 when I was shopping at Westgate Mall. I might have ordered on the mobile app then picked up my food right away because I remember service being really fast. I ordered the the Chicken-BLT protein box which is by far my favourite because of the tasty garlic-dijon aioli. So YUMMY!!

This is my 80th Yelp review overall. 
34th review for 2018."
Starbucks,Concord,3175 Rutherford Road,3.5,5,"It's always the best spot for me to study and catch up with work. The service is amazingly quick and the staffs are friendly. I don't have a point card ( I may have been VIP by now), but they know I'm their regular, so they give me free drink sometimes.

It doesn't have many tables or outlets, you need to be there early. I used to be there almost 8 hrs straight just to study and they didn't complain about me taking the spot for too long. Their wifi is fast!

I ordered drink from the secret menu (you can search it online), but the staffs were nice and carefully checked with menu on my phone to make sure they make it right for me. Some other places, even tho they still make you the drink, the staffs will show attitudes. Or they even said they didn't have enough ingredients for it. (Right, I don't think so)

They always write my name with a C but I don't really mind it (some know mine starts with K)

I've never had any bad experience with Starbucks here (other places, yes). And this will always be my favourite spot for me to study. I always feel extremely comfortable here."
Starbucks,Las Vegas,"5715 S. Eastern Ave., 101",3.5,5,"This is literally my favourite Starbucks in Las Vegas.. Those baristas in the mornings are FAST!

I visit this location every morning through the drive thru. It literally takes 60 seconds to get my husband & I our morning coffees and breakfast. I'm thoroughly impressed every morning with their speed and enthusiasm. My drinks are always made great and sometimes I even get an extra one :) 
This is the perfect Starbucks to go to in the morning if you're looking to get in and out before work."
Starbucks,Markham,2880 Major Mackenzie Drive E,3.5,5,"I've only been here once to exchange a mug as it broke when I poured hot water in it. After calling almost every single store, this store still had the one I wanted.

My original mug was bought months ago before it broke but it was my favourite mug. I was going to buy another one but the store manager was willing to exchange a new one for me. Super kind and understanding store manager!"
Starbucks,Markham,"7080 Warden Avenue, Building B, Unit 6",3.5,5,"Have been in a few times now since they changed the layout and apparently the management as well. Not that I had a problem with this place before, but they are REALLY on their game now. My favourite place to go in the morning because the vibe is fabulous. Thanks so much guys!!"
Starbucks,Markham,"70 Copper Creek Dr, Unit N",4,5,This is one of my favourite Starbucks locations. They provide amazing service and have always gotten my order right! There is adequate seating and most importantly they have DRIVE THRU!!
Starbucks,Markham,7676 Markham Road,4.5,5,"Very long ago, there was a Starbucks in this area and for some reason, it shut down and turned into a Nando's (not that I'm complaining because Nando's). That Starbucks was the closest to where I live and I did frequent it. However, when it closed down, I had to almost go out of my way to get my sick tea or my favourite frappe.

This is now. Across the road from where the old location was. This Starbucks opened just days ago and it's nice. It even has a little patio area! I can definitely see myself coming here a lot. Thanks for coming back to my hood!"
Starbucks,Markham,7333 Woodbine Avenue,3,5,"I love Starbucks coffee. My favourite drinks are ice coffee with vanilla syrup, americano, espresso and ice green tea no lemonade."
Starbucks,Mesa,2048 E Baseline Rd,2.5,5,"I think I lived at this Starbucks for the last year that I lived in AZ. I love the outdoor patio and the chairs and couches inside are always comfy. I never got harrassed by the employees about hanging around for like 3 hours or chilling out in the front making lots of noise with friends. There usually isn't a line, because this isn't a busy Starbucks. There's also the random magazine stands right in front of the store which are handy if you feel like reading something, but forgot a book.  The parking lot kinda sucks, but there's like 10 other stores using the same lot. One of my favourite Starbucks."
Starbucks,Mississauga,670 Eglinton Avenue W,4,5,"Finally a Starbucks closer than Square One Chapters! Glad to have one that's easily accessible.

Just recently opened up. I always get my favourite hot Mocha and the Frap version when I need to cool down.

Try it out sometime!"
Starbucks,Mississauga,1930 Fowler Drive,3.5,5,This is my favourite Starbucks. There is one guy who works there that is absolutely fantastic. He's super friendly and seems to remember you when you come in. They always get my order right and it's always quick.
Starbucks,Mississauga,670 Eglinton Avenue W,4,5,This is my favourite Starbucks. The staffs are friendly and they always got the orders right. I have been coming to this Starbucks for the last year. Recommend this place to everyone I know.
Starbucks,Montréal,474 Mcgill Street,3.5,5,"It's now my favourite location. Awesome staff nice decor. 

Caroline got the extra mile to find products they didn't had at the location. Really appreciated the effort. Some would simply had said ""we don't have it"" she sent me an email the same day with other locations having the product in stock"
Starbucks,Montréal,1500 Avenue Atwater,3,5,"My favourite place to get work done. I love their Passion Fruit Iced Tea. The service is fast and efficient, well worth the extra price (compared to Tim Hortons, where it's often slow and heartless). The staff is friendly. The WiFi is good. I absolutely love it."
Starbucks,Montréal,2440-2444 Rue Notre-Dame O,3.5,5,"This is my favourite STARBUCKS in Montreal, for the simple reason, I love the staff here, I used to do some of my freelance work here, and I got to know the staff. People can make a place so much better and that's exactly why I would give this place 5 stars."
Starbucks,Phoenix,"3175 E. Thomas Road, 101",2.5,5,"I don't feel like a person till I hit my favourite Starbucks every morning before work, the servers are very cool, the drive-thru is usually long but I guess we are all addicted to sugar and caffeine. Just got my fix driving away very happy"
Starbucks,Pittsburgh,1717 Cochran Road,4.5,5,"This Starbucks is right down the street from my parents house. It's gotta be my favourite location in the Pittsburgh area. I read Joe D's review and laughed a bit. He's right...there are some guys who sit in there, but have you ever said hello? Have you ever asked them if you could sit down? They're totally nice guys! The baristas here are really efficient (most of the time) and super friendly. They're on top of their game and even remember regular's drink orders."
Starbucks,Richmond Hill,11108 Yonge Street,3.5,5,"Amazing service. Due to being a population location, a lot of customer drinks can take time to make, however they make every moment right with amazing service from the great staff. Amazing cafe but can be crowded sometimes. One of my favourite Starbucks locations. Asked barista for suggestion of cool drinks and they always hit the spot. Love the workers there!"
Starbucks,Richmond Hill,11710 Yonge St,4,5,"This is my favourite place to chill! The customer service is supper friendly, and the music is not too loud. There are usually enough seats when I go, and the drinks are on point!"
Starbucks,Rocky River,19555 Detroit Road,4.5,5,This is my favourite sbux location to spend time in-I'll drive a bit out of my way to get to this one. The employees are friendly and fast. This Starbucks has a basement and an upstairs which means there is always a good spot to study. In the winter there is a basement fireplace.This place gets busy on weekends but there is pretty much always somewhere to sit.
Starbucks,Scarborough,"41 Milner Avenue, Unit 2",3,5,"My favourite Starbucks location in Scarborough.  Came here on a Sunday morning to grab a cup of coffee prior to Hot Yoga (yes I know, I am just asking for a death wish with this double dehydration!)  

I sat and sipped my java for a good hour or so, and there was never a shortage of sample trays being passed around.  Lemon-Cranberry Biscotti (sinfully sweet - to the point of a cavity-inducing level of discomfort), and a few of their new flavour frappuccinos.  I think within that hour I was there, 4 different samples passed me by.

Great patio and pretty spacious inside, although it does start to pile up rather quickly.  On a Sunday morning at 8:30AM (right when it opened), there were already about 5 patrons waiting... 

I heart this Starbucks!"
Starbucks,Scarborough,3740 Midland Avenue,3.5,5,"I'm a 100% Starbucks addict. So when I give this one a 5 star... it's because of the service and quality. I've been to COUNTLESS Starbucks all over the country and in Seattle(1st Starbucks in the world) but honestly, this is my favourite one yet. I haven't been here for a while so I was so shocked to see it so packed. The service is always very friendly and when they aren't sure about your customized order, they will ask you to confirm so they don't make it wrong. The place is always clean and friendly. This is the Starbucks that got me hooked all thanks to my dad almost 7 years ago."
Starbucks,Toronto,1062 Gerrard Street E,4,5,"I'm quite fond of my Starbucks and this one is one of my favourites as it has a rooftop patio. I'm not in the area too often, but if you are and want somewhere to just be a potato and drink coffee, this Starbucks is the place."
Starbucks,Toronto,438 Richmond Street W,3.5,5,"Needless to say, there are a large number of Starbucks around this area. The one I used to frequent the most was on King W., across from Grand and Toy. This one, nevertheless, is worthy of a further trek north. The people working there are always so friendly and so helpful and the line is almost never long, regardless of when I go. 

The patio outside is also great as it's not right beside the road but just far enough for people watching without getting dust all over from the cars. 

I can't commend the baristas here enough...one of my favourite SB locations."
Starbucks,Toronto,438 Richmond Street W,3.5,5,"Sometimes a Starbucks is just a Starbucks.  And sometimes with the right group of people working behind the counter, it becomes so much more.

I have always had top notch service at this Starbucks.  They are efficient, friendly, polite, and make great beverages.  I can't speak enough to the quality and caliber of the employees working there.

This is my favourite Starbucks to visit, and I'm so grateful it is the Starbucks that is closest to my office."
Starbucks,Toronto,438 Richmond Street W,3.5,5,"I don't normally review Starbucks, but i'm reviewing this one TWICE. I just want to point out that one of the baristas, Kris, really knows what he's doing with the drinks and is very insightful on the customizations people look for.

My favourite SB location of all time!"
Starbucks,Toronto,1842 Queen St E,3,5,"I love my local Starbucks! They are always so welcoming and happy. It is hard to start your day off without a smile after a visit here (so if you don't like smiling, don't go)  :) I've witnessed some pretty embarrassingly rude behaviour by some patrons (running low on caffeine in the bloodstream or parking illegally is not an excuse for a tantrum, sir!) but despite the abuse they keep on smiling. The only downside is when they run out of my favourite (stinky) asiago pretzel, but they don't lose a star - it's my own fault for telling too many people just how yummy they are. The only thing that would make this place even better is if I could tip when paying debit."
Starbucks,Toronto,555 University Avenue,4,5,"One of my favourite Starbucks because of the spacing. It's located in the hospital and it's very open concept. There's lots of small tables for you and a friend to enjoy. The line up can be enormous during rush hour, but if you can, go when it's not busy. I found service to be exceptional and it's just nice to grab a coffee, sit down somewhere close, and decompress and think, zen-like. A secret Starbucks that I'm happy to share with you."
Starbucks,Toronto,555 University Avenue,4,5,"My favourite Starbucks in the downtown core (maybe in the city?!). Great staff. Comfortable seating. Patio in the summer. 

Tip: for those studying and looking for a constant caffeine fix.  Buy a card or get the app (free refills on brewed coffee). There is a counter tucked on the side with 4 chairs. Perfect study location (I spent many a weekend here)."
Starbucks,Toronto,829 The Queensway,4,5,"This Starbucks is one of my favourites. It is big and nicely designed. It is also next to Costco, so you can grab your coffee once you are done with your shipping. I am also surprised by the staff, which is friendly and nice. All in all, a nice place to go and grab a coffee or stay in and take a break."
Starbucks,Toronto,407 Yonge Street,3.5,5,"One of my favourite Starbucks - definitely worth a review.

A fairly busy location, but they manage it quite well.
Great service, incredible manager and wonderful team.

Thanks for always remembering my name.
- ""Meghan's friend"". :)"
Starbucks,Toronto,941 College St,3.5,5,"I love this Starbucks! 
It's a smallish location but located right across from my favourite YMCA, it's always clean (including washrooms) and the staff are just awesome, consistently upbeat, love to chat and make great vanilla soy lattes."
Starbucks,Toronto,542 College Street,3,5,One of my favourite Starbucks in Toronto with great staff who were so friendly. Bring it back. This neighbourhood does not need anther bad bar or hipster sock/cap shop.
Starbucks,Toronto,6714 Kingston Road,4.5,5,Easily my favourite Starbucks location! Super-friendly staff and several different seating options make this a great place to catch up with friends or get some work done. This store is an excellent representative of the Starbucks brand. Having it so close to home is just a bonus.
Starbucks,Toronto,255 Morningside Avenue,3,5,one of my favourite Starbucks locational although i don't have time to come here often. The staffs are friendly and they were able to handle heavy order from me such as the butter beer or raspberry cheese cake. I always take out so i can not confirm other's complains about seatings in this place.
Starbucks,Toronto,17 Leslie Street,4,5,"Friendly staff, fast service, and great atmosphere.  Definitely my favourite Starbucks.  Stop by and check it out yourself!"
Starbucks,Toronto,81 Front Street E,4,5,"My favourite Starbucks in the city! This location, right next to St. Lawrence Market, has a nice amount of seating with a design aesthetic inspired by the history of Old Toronto.

This Reserve store has a wide variety of single-origin coffees from various regions, all of which can be enjoyed with the Clover brewer or purchased whole bean to enjoy at home. But what really makes this cafe special is the friendly baristas like Bob who make you feel right at home."
Starbucks,Toronto,81 Front Street E,4,5,"My favourite Starbucks! Always friendly and willing to go the extra mile for the client.

Shout-out to Bob... You're the best!"
Starbucks,Toronto,65 Front Street W,3.5,5,"Located in the York concourse, this is probably my favourite Starbucks around the area during the morning rush hour. I've tried about 3 other Starbucks locations in the area but they always left me disappointed and delayed my arrival time to work. The great thing about this Starbucks is that when I order on my phone, they know that there's going to be tons of orders so they designate a person to hand out the online orders. 

Even if I don't order online and order in person, they have a designated person to take peoples orders, enter it into the system beforehand and then once you go to the cashier you wouldn't have to repeat your order. Even though it's really busy, they don't even have to ask for your name. By the time I'm done paying, my drink is already prepared.

They also have about 10 people working during the morning rush and they're all very friendly which is the usual Starbucks. Other locations in the area should take note on how this one operates because it's a lot faster and I feel their system makes the employees not as stressed as others.  This Starbucks will definitely be a usual location for me every morning when I get off the train."
Starbucks,Toronto,888 Danforth Avenue,3,5,"One of the things that makes this store stand out is the Japanese style greeting you get upon entry.  A loud hello or hi.  
I understand that Levi, one of Starbucks Management people started it.
The staff is very upbeat and you can tell that this is a very happy store.
I like the fact that after being there only 6 times, the staff no longer asks me my name because they know it.
This is another new store replacing one a block west that closed. It is bright, airy and full of light.
Attached you will see my favourite barista there.  He, like all the staff at this location can take and give an appropriate joke.
You must give this location a try if you're on the Danforth!
Lastly, many people ask me why I seem to go to Starbucks when there are places that serve a better cup of coffee.  I can tell you why I'm one word: consistency.  I always get what I ask for with very little fuss.  Better still, when they do make a mistake.  They will go all out to make it right.  This location does that so well!"
Starbucks,Toronto,657 Dupont Street,4,5,"This has to be my favourite Starbucks in the city. It feels like you've stepped into a classy historic building with high ceilings and antique fixtures. It can be busy, but not nearly as insane as some of the other downtown locations. It's quiet enough to study with a delicious beverage by your side. 

The staff are your typical SBux employees - friendly, funny and welcoming. I've had great drinks made by the baristas - no issues yet. 

I regularly order the blonde roast coffee, which has always been great. Once in awhile I will spoil myself and have a frappucino - the green tea frapp is amazing! 

My only complaint is that the washrooms can get rather dirty and left without toilet paper at times."
Starbucks,Toronto,765 Yonge Street,3.5,5,"Generally, I prefer to support smaller, independent coffee chains, but as far as Starbucks go, this one is great. The service is often quite friendly. 

They have a Clover machine and a variety of different reserve coffees to try. They can be kind of expensive, anywhere from $4 to $5+ for a short with tax.

They had all recently had a tasting and everyone was very excited about the Jamaican Blue Mountain, which is an extremely rare coffee. I got one and it came to $5.30 with tax. I didn't like it as much as I liked other Clovers they brewed. I think the Blue Java is one of my favourites, and that one's a bit more affordable. Sometimes, depending on the variety and possibly the barista, I can either drink it black or I have to add dairy. Crema, the independent coffee shop that shares a space with Freshii just a bit south east of this one also has a Clover machine. Those are the 2 Clover machines I know of in the city.

Overall, this is one of the best Starbucks I've been to in the city. I love the option to get fancy Clover-brewed coffee. The staff's positive energy is also very welcoming but as a disclaimer I must mention that they were all wired up from a coffee tasting. 

If you are looking for Starbucks then I'd recommend this Starbucks."
Starbucks,Toronto,2201 Dundas St W,3.5,5,"Probably my favourite Starbucks in the world. The staff is always having a good time, serving bless drinks, and hookin it up phat for the fam. This establishment is a pillar of the community."
Starbucks,Unionville,201 Main Street,3.5,5,"This is my favourite Starbucks location in Ontario. While it can be busy at peak hours, it offers different areas for guests. There is an upstairs area for studying and quiet conversations, and a lounge area downstairs. The lounge area downstairs is perfect for a small gathering of a family or young professionals that would enjoy a fireside chat because of the ambience and the installation of a fireplace. There is also neat decors such as books and vintage pictures of Starbucks!

PS: For those that have been to the Harvard University Starbucks in Boston, MA - it has a similar vibe but just smaller. This can very well be the best Starbucks in Canada. Unfortunately they do not have the Clover brewing machine or the Starbucks reserve edition coffee selection.

As of today, they've got a lot of 2015 end-of-life-cycle merchandise such as tumblers and mugs! Get on that discount if you are into that kind of stuff."
Starbucks,Unionville,201 Main Street,3.5,5,"Alecsandra the store manager works hard to ensure the SB experience rocks

this is my favourite location

friendly, happy staff, smiles and rockin barristas going all out

i enjoy the tall bold 2 milks but if you ever want a low fat, skinny, no foam, hot, dark, bold, latte with a squirt of caramel......i have seen this nightmare ordered and they produce without fail.......they can also do a dirty, long espresso double wrapped.......but really lets just enjoy the coffee without trying to show off how complicated we can want a latte

dont forget a pop treat on a stick and the free wifi for your Playbook or ShoreTel powered iPad"
Starbucks,Urbana,102 N Vine Street,2.5,5,"Hello, my favourite Starbucks location. You make strong espressos & let me combine flavours into a frankenfrap. Wifi and outdoor seating is lovely. I show up unannounced & your friendly baristas introduced me to your delicious glazed donut. I would be 100 pounds heavier if I hadn't biked here, which warrants me to tell you that your bike parking is a bit lacking. I like that this location is away from campus & the increasingly congested North Prospect sty. The staff seems friendlier & less rushed. The café is often less crowded. But now that I'm professing my adoration for this Starbucks on Yelp, there may be a mad rush here for the tasty custom drinks, glazed donuts, bike parking, friendlies, and that corner chair that I enjoy so much..."
